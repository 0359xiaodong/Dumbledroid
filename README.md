Android + webservice = magic!

Download the [example app on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.leocad.dumbledroidexample) to see it in action!

##Current version
1.0 (20130227). Download the binary here: [dumbledroid-1.0.jar](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/5135185/blog/dumbledroid-1.0.jar).

##Purpose
Dumbledroid is a framework that enables integration between an Android app and a RESTful server using magic. ~~Actually, it's not real magic. I'm kidding.~~

Using Dumbledroid, the developer doesn't have to write parsers for JSON or XML documents from a web service. It maps the document nodes to the class fields and does this automagically!

Dumbledroid also does automatic caching in memory and in disk. *Presto!*

##Origin of the name
Dumbledroid was named after the magician [Dumbledore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumbledore), a ~~blatant copy of Gandalf~~ major character of the *Harry Potter* series.

##How it works
This framework gets the names of the JSON/XML nodes and uses [reflection](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/reflect/index.html) to find out the names of the class fields. Then, it maps the value of the first to the second.

It also adds non-intrusive memory caching using [SoftReferences](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/java/lang/ref/SoftReference.html), i.e., when the garbage collector needs the memory, it is freed. The disk cache works by saving the data to the user's SD card.

Furthermore: its connection with the web service is smart. Dumbledroid only opens a connection and checks the headers. If the web service's version wasn't modified since the last time Dumbledroid downloaded it, the framework will use the cached version.

##Usage
You can find a whole working example on the `DumbledoreExample` folder of this repository. It's a working Android project that uses the Dumbledore framework. But for the purposes of this manual, following are step by step instructions.

###Step 1: Add the framework to your Android project
You can do this in two different ways: importing the Dumbledroid project on Eclipse and [referencing it as a library project](https://developer.android.com/tools/projects/projects-eclipse.html#ReferencingLibraryProject) or simply copying the binary file (.jar) to the `libs` directory of your Android project. You can find the latest binary on the "Current Version" paragraph of this document.

###Step 2: Add the permissions to your AndroidManifest.xml
Dumbledroid requires the following permissions to work:

    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />

The `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` is optional and is used by the disk cache.

###Step 3: Write your classes
You'll need to write your classes that correspond to your JSON or XML document.

For example, if you have a JSON like this:

    {
    	"name": "Luke",
    	"surname": "Skywalker",
    	"age": 18,
    	"isFromDarkSide": false,
    	"averageShipSpeed": 138.46
    }

You'll need to write a class like this:

    public class Jedi extends AbstractModel {
        
    	private String name;
    	private String surname;
    	private int age;
    	private boolean isFromDarkSide;
    	private double averageShipSpeed;
    
    	public Jedi() {
    		super("YOUR_JSON_URL");
    	}
    	
    	@Override
    	protected DataType getDataType() {
    		return DataType.JSON;
    	}
    }

The names of the class fields should be exactly the names of the JSON nodes. The class must extend `AbstractModel`, provide an URL in the constructor and return `DataType.JSON` or `DataType.XML` in the `getDataType()` method.

Feel free to make the fields public or to write getters and setters. Dumbledroid doesn't care about that.

###Step 4: Call Dumbledroid from within your Activity (or Context)
After that, you'll just need to do this:

    Jedi jedi = new Jedi();
    jedi.load();

That's it. Your JSON is already parsed and mapped to the Jedi instance. If you enabled caching, Dumbledroid already took care of that for you. Simple, isn't it?

*Note: make sure to call `load()` from a background thread, or [your app can crash](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/perf-anr.html).*
